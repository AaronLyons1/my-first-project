This website was a struggle, through out the course ive been stuck on certain 
objects or struggling to rememebr sertain parts of the code aswel as half way 
through this project i was in a severe accident that threathed my life. The injuries
i sustained from this cause me to be un-able to type or look at a screen for too long or even
remember what was happening. My memory was limited and my attention span was gone.
I was in an out of hospital like a yoyo but through pure determination i managed to complete this 
project, even though it is a late submission afer getting a medical note to say extand the deadline
but wasnt approved i got it done.

The idea for this project came from a person in slack, i was stuck staring at a wall for two hours 
and finally crashed. I asked the general chat in slack and this kind man gave me the idea to do something 
with cars. I trained as a mechanic from young but found a new passion for computers and decided to persue it.
I found the idea of adding the "change tire section" in the video this person asked sixty people in
an office and over fifthy people said no. This absolutly blew me away, then i asked my best friend 
if he thought of it and he said good followed by him saying that oil in the car runs out and u need 
to top it up. I mean i knew people didmt know everything about cars but this was just ridiculous
to me. I'm not trying to say i'm the best car fixer to ever walk the earth but i said id try
my best to teach people the absolute basics.

Page Layouts
The first thing you are greeted with is a quick message and the nav bar for going around the sites pages.
this layout for the top was actually designed by booststrap. Now i know bootstrap is slightly frowned 
opun because people will just use booststraps intagrated html, css and the most difficult part the 
media queeres but as you can see from my code this is not the case for me. I intagrated my own css
and media for nearly all screen sizes. ![](assets/images/heading.png) and this style carries on 
throughout the site as shown here ![](assets/images/heading2.png) ![](assets/images/heading3.png).
The pourpose of this was to create stability and structure across the site with changed background 
to just add the small element of style to it, last thing I wanted was people getting too overwhelemed 
at the beginning and leaving. the whole idea was to get people who now days have a very short attention
span. I know this because I myself struggle with this.

Then the sites move down into the main informative part of the page, this is the most text heavy part of the 
site, i tried to make this easier on the eyes and interactive enough to where its difficult to not get borde.
I achived this by in the index.htlm by adding a short twenty second video of someonw checkng their oil
![](assets/images/mid.png) and in the how-to.html i added youtube videos for some mabey further 
explain on what i was trying to say like this ![](assets/images/mid2.png) ![](assets/images/mid3.png)
